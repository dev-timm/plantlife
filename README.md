# PlantLife

With so many social media platforms out there, PlantLife aims to be a home for people who want to celebrate everything plant. Plant enthusiasts can present their newest acquisitions, share useful tips, buy, sell or exchange plants with others - or just geek out on any plant related topics.

## Product Decisions 

### User Needs
As a user I want to...
- ...meet other plant enthusiasts so that I can build new connections with likeminded people
- ...exchange information with other users so that I can learn new things about plants
- ...follow people that post interesting plant content so that my feed filters out any uninteresting topics
- ...buy, sell or give away plants so that I can expand my collection or share my own plants with others

### MVP
PlantLifeâ€™s MVP is meant to be a simple version of a social media app that brings together plant enthusiasts from around the world. Core features consist of profile customization, reading, writing, editing and deleting posts and advertisements as well as an overview of all users with the option to follow each other.


## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
Creating the wireframes before the start of development allowed more time for the coding phase as a lot of time was saved by having less need for design changes.

### Usability

#### Layout
The layout is usually organized within 1-2 columns so that the actions and important content are easy to see.

#### Colors
The primary color is a vibrant green that represents nature and plants. It has a good contrast to white, which is important for UI elements such as buttons. Overall the color should give a positive feeling to the user and make it easy to identify important elements.
